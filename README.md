### Requirements
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Steps to follow
1. Go to the [repository](https://github.com/Computer-Science-Undergraduate-Council/CSUG-resources) 
2. [Fork the repository to your GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) using the Fork tool at the top right. This will create a copy (actually a fork) in your GitHub for you to work on.
3. [Clone the repository to your local computer](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository). This will create a local version in your computer. This is linked with your remote repository (the repository on your GitHub)
4. Add your resources in the apropriate ReadMe.
5. Add your changes to your local git using `git add .` (The dot at the end is important)
6. Commit your changes with a helpful message. Example: `git commit -m "Added informative ReadMe.md file"` 
10. Push your code to your remote repository using `git push origin main`. If this fails, then git will automatically give you a suggestion to 'set upstream' with the link to your remote repo. Copy this and type the push command again.
7. [Create a Pull Request(PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for your remote repo to be merged with the organization's. Here, you can compare your changes, add more detailed messages and then submit the Pull Request (PR).  
8. Once an organization member reviews your PR, your PR will be merged.
